# bf16
The first ever _visual_ Brainfuck runtime built for running interactive games.

## Usage
Run `./build.sh` to compile (if on Linux). This will produce two binaries - `bf16` and `bf16_grayscale`. The former uses an RGB332 palette, the latter renders in grayscale. Test with the programs under `examples/`. Note that `badapple.b` is best used with `bf16_grayscale`.

## Contributing
Submit issues before pull requests (discuss, then code), and adhere to the code style. Ideally, use the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) naming scheme. Code that doesn't respect the style/conventions of the code base will not be accepted.
